In this lab you learned how to use Spring Security to ensure that only authenticated, authorized users have access to the Family Cash Card API. In addition, you followed best practices in the Controller and Repository layers of our application to ensure that only the _correct_ users have access to their (and only their) Cash Card data. You also learned that Spring Security not only protects our requests, but it also modifies our API's error handling as to avoid "leaking" information about crashes and other internal operations occurring with our application.
