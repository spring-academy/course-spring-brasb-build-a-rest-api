In this lab, you implemented a RESTful Delete endpoint which doesn't "leak" security information to would-be attackers. You also had a chance to do a small, but useful refactoring to practice the Red, Green, Refactor process.

This is the last of the CRUD operations to implement in the API, which brings us to a successful conclusion of our technical work. Congratulations!
