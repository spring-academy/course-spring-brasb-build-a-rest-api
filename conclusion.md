You’ve now built a fully-functional, robust, and secure REST API using Spring Boot!

## Your Accomplishments

Let’s review all your course accomplishments:

@@@checks
{
"list": "You’ve delved into **REST** and **the lore of HTTP verbs**: not just `GET`, but also `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `POST`. || You've used **HTTP response status codes** as designed: not just `200 OK`, but `204 NO CONTENT` and `201 CREATED` as well. || By using Spring Boot, you’ve now got a solid understanding of Spring. You learned about its Inversion of Control container, how to use annotations, and how to employ **auto-configuration** to free you from configuration tasks. || You built the API using a **layered architecture**. You understand how Spring Security sits at the “front” of the API, Spring Web enables HTTP communications between the API and its clients, and Spring Data handles reading and writing to/from the relational data store. || You used a **test-first** approach to provide confidence that your application works as designed while driving out your app's functionality. || You drove your implementation using a **Steel Thread** - exercising all the integration points and validating your architecture early on to de-risk your functionality. || You used the **Red, Green, Refactor** process to improve your code (and tests!) throughout the application development."

## Keep Learning

Throughout this course, we’ve used simple and proven Spring technologies, striving to keep the application only as complex as it needs to be. While we’ve employed only a small subset of the Spring framework, you’ll encounter many more Spring technologies, patterns, and architectures as you work on more Spring-based projects.

To continue building your knowledge, check out our [Spring Certified Professional](https://spring.academy/learning-path) learning path. You’ll expand upon your foundational knowledge with [Spring Framework Essentials](https://spring.academy/courses/spring-framework-essentials), followed by a deeper dive into [Spring Boot](https://spring.academy/courses/spring-boot). Packed with hands-on exercises, focused on fundamentals, and fine-tuned to prepare you for the certification exam, this learning path is your ticket to Spring pro status.
