You’ll create a Family Cash Card REST API project using the Spring Initializr. Then, you’ll learn why JSON is the preferred data interchange format for the Spring Initializr, and why JSON and API contracts matter.

You’re also going to create endpoints in the REST API for the Family Cash Card Service. In a REST API, an endpoint is the connection point (URI) to a specific function such as loading more money, or deleting a family cash card.

Test first is another hot topic. You’ll find out why it’s important to exercise test-first development on a JSON data contract, and why it makes sense to test a code sample before writing all of the functionality in code.
