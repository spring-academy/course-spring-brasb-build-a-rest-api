API contracts are a popular means for API providers and consumers to agree upon how an API will behave. API contracts can be as simple as shared documentation to sophisticated contract management and validation frameworks. Combined with JSON (the most popular data interchange format for modern web-based applications) contracts can be a powerful means to help API providers and consumers develop and test APIs.

You'll implement automated testing and verification of API contracts later in this course.
